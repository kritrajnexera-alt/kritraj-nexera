              We started KritRaj Nexera because &quot;just a website&quot; was
              never enough.

            <p>
              Most agencies sell you a website. It launches, it looks good, and
              then nothing happens. The form submissions sit in an inbox. The
              follow-ups never go out. The leads quietly disappear.
            </p>
            <p>
              We saw this happen again and again — to clinics, real estate
              firms, retailers, service businesses of every kind. They weren&apos;t
              short on leads. They were short on a system to catch them.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we built KritRaj Nexera around a different idea: a website is
              only useful if it&apos;s wired to the automation that captures,
              routes, and follows up on every enquiry — automatically. That&apos;s
              the whole offer. Not design. Not pages.{" "}

                  Rajnish spent years building websites and automation workflows
                  for businesses that kept hitting the same wall: traffic was
                  coming, but leads were vanishing between the contact form and
                  the first reply. He saw great products lose to slower
                  competitors simply because the faster competitor responded
                  first.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That gap — between an enquiry landing and a business actually
                  acting on it — is where most revenue leaks out. Rajnish
                  founded KritRaj Nexera to close it for good: pairing the sites
                  he builds with the n8n automation that makes them work.

                  &ldquo;I got tired of watching businesses pay for a website

                  out there working — capturing leads, routing them, following
                  up — even at 2am. That&apos;s what we build.&rdquo;
