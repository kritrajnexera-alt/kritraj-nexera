            We don&apos;t have client testimonials yet, so we won&apos;t fake
            them. What we do have: a live, working demo below, and a
            founding-client offer — we&apos;re onboarding our first few
            businesses at a discounted rate in exchange for a case study once
            your system is live. You see it work before you pay full price.
